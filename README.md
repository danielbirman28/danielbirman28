<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects Projects:</h2>

- <b>[NBA Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/danielbirman28/NBA_Stats_Analysis_Project) - July 2023</b>
  (Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, Matplotlib)
  - Analyzed and manipulated multiple datasets with over 10,000 rows of NBA player stats using Python, pandas, and NumPy
  - Developed a predictive model using logistic regression for forecasting a player‚Äôs career outcome, supported by data analysis and visualization tools like seaborn and Matplotlib
  - Employed data cleaning techniques, mathematical adjustments, and data frame concatenation to categorize NBA players' career outcomes season by season
- <b>Image Processing App - March 2023</b>
(Python)
  - Coded the ability to negate, grayscale, rotate 180¬∞, replace the background image, replace specific color, and add a sticker overlay to an inputted RGB Image
  - Implemented a K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning classifier to predict a label for a given RGB image
- <b>Digit Classifier Program - May 2023</b>
(Java)
  - Designed and developed an image recognition system for hand-drawn digits
  - Utilized a d-ary heap, priority queue, interfaces, and KNN classifier
- <b>Celebrity Search Engine - April 2023</b>
(Java)
  - Allocated a Binary Search Tree (BST) and used it to create a basic search engine
  - Read a file containing movie data, populate BSTs based on keywords, and perform queries to find related movies, actors, and movie studios
